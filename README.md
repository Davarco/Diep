# Oipe.id
Welcome to Oipe.id, the single best replacement for the popular online game, Diep.io! Here you will find... you know what never mind this is a school project k bye.

## Controls
MOVEMENT - Arrow Keys OR WASD<br />
FIRE - Space (100 points for every AI tank killed)<br />
ENABLE/DISABLE AUTO-FIRE - E<br />
DIRECT YOUR FIRE - Point your cursor in the desired direction :)

## Notes
AI tanks will attempt to shoot at you AND to dodge your fire. If you're hit by an AI bullet, you will lose 10 health. The max & starting health is 100.<br />
Fortunately, you have constant health regeneration going on, as well as health-pack power-ups (the plus signs) popping up from time to time.<br />
Speaking of power-ups, there's also x2 bullet damage (the lightning) and x2 bullet speed (the double arrow).<br /><br />

Did we mention you can collect and activate up to three of each of the bullet power-ups at the same time??<br />
One last thing about power-ups --> if you don't need it, don't try to pick it up, because you WILL pick it up, and it WON'T do anything to help (or hurt) you.<br /><br />

Oh yeah, don't forget to have fun!
