# Oipe.id
Welcome to Oipe.id, the single best replacement for the popular online game, Diep.io! Here you will find... you know what never mind this is a school project k bye.

# Controls
MOVEMENT - Arrow Keys OR WASD
FIRE - Space (100 points for every AI tank killed)
ENABLE/DISABLE AUTO-FIRE - E
DIRECT YOUR FIRE - Point your cursor in the desired direction :)

# Notes
AI tanks will attempt to shoot at you AND to dodge your fire. If you're hit by an AI bullet, you will lose 10 health. The max & starting health is 100.
Fortunately, you have constant health regeneration going on, as well as health-pack power-ups (the plus signs) popping up from time to time.
Speaking of power-ups, there's also x2 bullet damage (the lightning) and x2 bullet speed (the double arrow).

Did we mention you can collect and activate up to three of each of the bullet power-ups at the same time??
One last thing about power-ups --> if you don't need it, don't try to pick it up, because you WILL pick it up, and it WON'T do anything to help (or hurt) you.

Oh yeah, don't forget to have fun!
